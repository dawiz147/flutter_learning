# Flutter Learning Playground

Welcome to my Flutter Learning Playground! This repository serves as a space for me to explore and expand my knowledge of the Flutter framework. Here, I will be experimenting with various Flutter features, testing different functionalities, and honing my skills in mobile app development.

## About Me

I've been actively involved in Flutter development for approximately a year now, both in my professional work and personal projects. My journey with Flutter began at work, where I've had the opportunity to contribute to the development of calendar.

## Goals

- **Skill Enhancement**: Continuously improve my proficiency in Flutter and stay updated with the latest features and best practices.
- **Experimentation**: Test various Flutter components, libraries, and design patterns to gain a deeper understanding of their functionality.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document my learning process and share insights with the community.

## Branches

- **`main`**: This branch is intended for finished and tested code snippets. Code in this branch is expected to be stable and functional.
- **`dev`**: The development branch serves as a sandbox where not all features may be working. It's a space for ongoing experiments and work in progress.
